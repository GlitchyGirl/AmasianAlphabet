# AmasianAlphabet
This is an attempt to create a true type font of the glyph/letter system used by the Amasian people from the fictional series Synduality. 

* What the project does - The purpose of this project is to help curate, and update the files used to create the Amasian type font for any fan of the community, or people who just want a cool looking font to play with. 

* Why the project is useful - this was created in hope of helping make it easier to decipher and translate text pertaining to the lore of Synduality.  Whether it be the anime, Synduality: Noir, the manga, upcoming game, or any other media related to the Synduality Universe.


* How users can get started with the project - Don't be afraid to stand on the shoulders of giants, as it's said!  Check out what's already been done on the github already, or any notes.  If you want to talk with folks more in real time, do feel free to stop  by the Synduality: Ada discord where all this mess started!   
 
* Where users can get help with your project - best place to do that that I can think of is going to be on the Discord for Synduality Ada's project which can be found here! " https://discord.gg/XwSJ9akKdJ ".  Other than that feel free to reach out to me on Blue Sky over at glitchygirl.bsky.social!

* Who maintains and contributes to the project
GlitchyGirl ... that'd be me!  
And well... anyone else who wants to!   No idea where it'll go... this is my first attempt at a github repo!
